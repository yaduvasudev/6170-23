#### **Contact**

We will set up a discussion forum on Zulip. This will be the first point of contact for any issues related to the course. Please do not email me or the TAs unless the issue is specific to you (like missing lectures, correction in grading). Even for such issues, we highly recommend you to message privately using the discussion forum.

For general questions related to the course (any comments/doubts), please create a topic in the correct stream and add you question/comment there. You are also welcome to reply and clear the doubts of your friends.
